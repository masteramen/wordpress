Auto Excerpt for your posts on home, search and archive pages. Customize Read More button and thumbnail image. Easy to configure and have a lot of options.
== Description ==

Easy Custom Auto Excerpt is a WordPress plugin to cut/excerpt your posts displayed in home, search or archive pages. This plugin also enables you to customize the read more button text and thumbnail image. Just activate the plugin, configure some options and you're good to go :)

ECAE only works on themes that call `the_content()` or `the_excerpt()` on home, search & archive pages. ECAE does not support themes that use custom functions to display excerpt, like Total, OceanWP, Writee, and Customizr.
