== Troubleshooting ==

The Ad Widget is a very simple plugin. If you are having trouble
loading ads on your site, please make sure that:

* You do not have an ad blocker installed (you would be amazed how often this happens). Disable it and refresh the page a few times to see if the ad appears.
* You don't have CSS in your theme which is hiding images (rare, but it happens)

If you have any other trouble, email kenny@broadstreetads.com - try to avoid
the Wordpress support forums because they're awful.

== Installation ==

First: Turn off any ad blockers you might have installed. They prevent
ads from appearing!

Other than that, there aren't any special instructions for installing this plug-in. Once
installed, go to Appearance -> Widgets, and look for the "Ad Widget" widgets!

You can also go to Settings -> Ad Widget for a video demo on how to use it.
