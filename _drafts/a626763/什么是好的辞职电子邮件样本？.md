Dear HR/ Boss name,

I would like to inform you that I am resigning from my position here as a System Analyst. My last day will be December 6.

Thank you so much for all of the opportunities [Company Name] has provided me. I have learned so much these time, and will never forget the kindness of all of my colleagues.

During my last working day, I’ll do everything possible to wrap up my duties.

Let me know if there is anything I can do to make this transition easier. I wish the organization continued success, and I hope to stay in touch in the future.

I appreciate the opportunities for growth that you have provided me.

Thank you again for your years of support and encouragement.

Warm Regards,

Your Name
